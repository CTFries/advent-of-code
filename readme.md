# Advent of Code Solutions Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my repository where I share my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges, an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles. My solutions range from powershell, go, javascript and python.

## About the Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles, which I have completed in various programming languages. I have also included the input data for each day's challenges, as well as any dependencies that are needed to run the solutions.

In recent years, my roles have change to more business and management, I don't get to code as often as I used to. Participating in AoC is a way for me to keep my programming skills sharp and my brain actively engaged in coding. It's a creative outlet that allows me to dive back into hands-on programming, which I am passionate about.

Moreover, AoC serves as a platform for me to learn new programming languages and refresh my knowledge of languages I already know. It exposes me to a diverse range of problems, many of which I don't typically encounter in my professional work. From pathfinding algorithms to bitwise mathematics, AoC presents an array of 'wild' problems that are not just educational but also immensely fun to solve. This yearly tradition is more than just solving puzzles; it's about growing as a programmer, challenging myself, and reigniting my love for coding in new and exciting ways.

In this structure:
In this structure:

- "Root" is the root directory of your repository.
- "[Year]" represents different years (e.g., 2023, 2022).
- Each "Day" directory corresponds to a specific day in the Advent of Code challenges.
- "puzzleOne" and "puzzleTwo" are your solution files, with `[filetype]` replaced by the file extension appropriate to the programming language you used (e.g., `.js` for JavaScript, `.py` for Python).
- "input.txt" contains the input data for that day's challenges.
- "[Dependencies if any]" refers to additional files or directories that are needed for certain solutions, such as `package.json` or `node_modules` for JavaScript projects.

## Progress Tracker 26/402

I don't have all the code from all years here, but I intend to go back and complete the ones I've done in prior years so that it is contained in one space.
